**Hey there, Project Manager in a production factory by day, studying code and contributing to open source projects by night**

I enjoy spending my time broadening my coding experience. I have followed programs with [The C# Academy](https://thecsharpacademy.com/#) to learn C# and .NET and currently following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s javascript course to get better at front end. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and TypeScript
- ðŸ’¬ I enjoy gaming, both table top and video games.
- ðŸ’» I'm comfortable in C#, Javascript, SQL
